You're seeing this error because your Linux system is running **Debian/Ubuntu** with **Python package protection (PEP 668)** enabled. It **prevents you from using `pip` to install packages system-wide** ‚Äî which is actually a good thing. It protects the system Python environment from being broken by accidental upgrades or changes.

### ‚úÖ ‚úÖ The Recommended Fix: **Use a Virtual Environment**

This is the safest and cleanest solution.

#### üëâ Step-by-step:

1. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate it:**

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Now install Flask & bcrypt safely inside it:**

   ```bash
   pip install flask bcrypt
   ```

4. **Run your app:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

---

### ‚ùì Why This Works:

* You're installing all packages **only inside `./venv/`**
* It avoids modifying your system Python environment
* You can delete the venv any time without affecting anything else

### üß™ (Optional) If `python3-full` is missing:

If step 1 fails, try installing it:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-full
```

Let me know if you want me to bundle the app with a pre-built virtual environment or make a `.sh` script that sets everything up automatically.
