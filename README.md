You're seeing this error because your Linux system is running **Debian/Ubuntu** with **Python package protection (PEP 668)** enabled. It **prevents you from using `pip` to install packages system-wide** — which is actually a good thing. It protects the system Python environment from being broken by accidental upgrades or changes.

### ✅ ✅ The Recommended Fix: **Use a Virtual Environment**

This is the safest and cleanest solution.

#### 👉 Step-by-step:

1. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate it:**

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Now install Flask & bcrypt safely inside it:**

   ```bash
   pip install flask bcrypt
   ```

4. **Run your app:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

---

### ❓ Why This Works:

* You're installing all packages **only inside `./venv/`**
* It avoids modifying your system Python environment
* You can delete the venv any time without affecting anything else

---

### 🧪 (Optional) If `python3-full` is missing:

If step 1 fails, try installing it:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-full
```

---

Great — now that you have `python3-full` installed, you're all set to use virtual environments.

### 🧹 To Delete a `venv` Virtual Environment:

If you've already created a virtual environment named `venv`, here’s how to delete it:

---

### ✅ Steps:

1. **Deactivate it** *(if it’s currently active)*:

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

2. **Delete the `venv` folder**:

   ```bash
   rm -rf venv
   ```

That’s it — this fully removes the virtual environment and all its packages.

---

### 🧠 Reminder:

* The `venv` folder is **self-contained** — deleting it has **no effect** on your system Python or anything else.
* You can always create a new one with:

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  ```
